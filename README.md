# Neural-Network-Simulation-with-Named-Pipes-in-C-
This project demonstrates the workings of a neural network using inter-process communication (IPC) with named pipes in C++. It includes a basic simulation of data flow through the layers of a neural network, illustrating how different components interact in a multi-threaded environment.
